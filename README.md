# Warning

There is no encryption of transferred data and no proper authentication. This is the responsibility of the next layer. So it's recommended to tunnel only ssh or vpn connections via this tool.

# Concepts

Server here is a machine with external ip which is accessible from the client machine.

Client is a machine which you want to forward a port to.
